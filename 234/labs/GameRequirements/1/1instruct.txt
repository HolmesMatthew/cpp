Instructions:

Create a Potion class using the predefined C++ string class as the data type for the appropriate data members 
shown in the class diagram below.

Stipulations
You must use the attached UML class diagram in the creation of this program. You may modify the UML to add 
functionality to your potions.

Test with an array of potions. 

When they are displayed, display the cost in gold and silver pieces. 
    For example, 0.1.23.15 would be 0 platinum, 1 gold, 23 silver, and 15 copper.
    Using your array of potions, display the entire worth   of the potions 

(Note: This should not be in the class as the class is a single potion with no concept of an array of potions,
    you may have a conversion function in the class though). 

Make sure that if you have more than 99 copper, silver or gold, convert to the higher denomination.
For example, 105 silver will be displayed as 1 gold and 5 silver.
