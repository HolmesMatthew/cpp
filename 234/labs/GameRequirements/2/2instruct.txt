Instructions:

Write a Dynamic Array class that handles the appropriate operations 
to create a dynamic array of potions. 

Make sure to test the functionality of the class, 
as it will be used in the next lab. 

I want the following class diagram as the minimum functionality however; 
you can add other functions that you deem necessary.
