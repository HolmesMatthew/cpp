/*INSTRUCTIONS
For the following, create a Word document for part 1 and 2, saved in your Lab1 folder 

Complete the following programming challenges:


Part 1:

A long time pen-pal of yours from another county has recently come to stay with you and attend your school for this 
academic term. She asks you to review the following pseudocode solution and help her determine if it would at least appear 
to be logically correct. Even though we have just touched the surface in relation to using and writing algorithms, you volunteer 
(ok, perhaps somewhat reluctantly) to help her out. Basically, your friend is trying to write a pseudocode solution to find the sum 
of the first five natural numbers. She shows you the problem statement and her solution below and asks you the following questions: 


Is the solution proposed logically correct? If not, what is wrong and how would you correct it? 
How might you be able to actually prove her solution works? 
What suggestions do you have to actually prove her solution works? 
 
Problem: Construct an algorithm to find and print out the sum of the first five positive, non-zero integer numbers. 

SET x to 0 

SET n to 0 

WHILE n < 5 

ADD n to x 

Print out x 

Please write your response to each of the specific questions above (1-3). In addition, rewrite the entire solution addressing all 
of your concerns and correcting any errors. 

 

Part 2:

Remember your old pen-pal friend from another country (you know, from the last chapter)? Well now she is mad and wondering why it is 
that most of the world uses the metric system, except for a few countries including the USA. While you donâ€™t necessarily want to help 
her debate the various political issues associated with this topic, you are willing to help her with the translation of miles to metric 
conversion problem. As you can see the complexity of the problem she is trying to solve is perhaps a bit more difficult and challenging. 
She again asks you to review the following pseudocode solution and help her determine if it is logically correct. Even though we just got 
started with pseudocode, you again agree to help her out.  

 

Your friend is trying to write a pseudocode solution to outline the steps required to convert a given distance entered by someone in kilometers 
to miles. In an effort to help you judge the accuracy of the algorithm below, your friend tells you the following information: 

a. She prefers the metric system 

b. A kilometer is 1000 meters 

c. One kilometer is less than one mile 

d. Kilometers per mile is approximately 1.6093 kilometers 

She asked you for help with the following tasks. 

1. We know that 15 miles is approximately 24.14 kilometers. Using this information how might you be able to actually prover her solution works? 
(i.e., is the solution proposed below logically correct?) If thereis a problem below, fix it! 

2. What suggestions do you have to improve the overall readability of her pseudocode? 

Problem: Write the pseudocode to ask a person to enter a distance in miles and display the converted distance in kilometers. You are likely to
 need to refer to some of the background information presented above.  

DISPLAY PROMPT 

"PLEASE ENTER IN THE MILES YOU WANT TO CONVERT:" 

READ MILES 

KILOMETERS = MILES * 1.3069                            DISPLAY MILE 

DISPLAY "MILES = " 

DISPLAY KILOMETER                                              DISPLAY "KILOMETERS" 

Please write your response to each of the specific questions above (1 and 2). In addition, rewrite the entire solution addressing all of 
your concerns and correcting any errors. Make it a point to keep readability in mind as you rewrite your solution. 

 

 

Part 3:

Write a C++ Program to calculate how old you are in days. Declare an integer variable and initialize it to your age. Also declare a constant 
that represents the number of days in a year. Make sure you first write your pseudocode solution before attempting to write your code. 
HINT: Here is an example of an assignment statement that might be similar to what you will need in your C++ code to perform the actual 
calculation: gross = hours * RATE; . Of course you will also need to use cout. */
