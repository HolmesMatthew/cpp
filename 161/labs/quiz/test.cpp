Write a program to fulfill the following requirements:

You need a program to help you plan a garden.  The user will enter

The square footage of their garden plot

Their needs for each of several types of plants (you wonâ€™t know ahead of time how many types). 

For each plant they will specify the length of the rows, their width, and the number of rows.

After each plant is entered, the program is to calculate the square footage used for that plant and 
display the remaining square footage left in the garden.  

The program should then ask them if they want to plant something else.
If the user tries to enter too much for a plant compared to what is left, the program should tell them of their error and tell 
them the square footage that will actually be used for that plant.

The user is not required to fill their garden space.

When the user is done entering plants, the program should display the total square footage used, 
the number of plant types and the amount of space remaining.

The type of loop you use is your choice.  You must use a function to calculate the area used for each plant type.
