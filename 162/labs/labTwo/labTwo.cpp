Mode Function

In statistics, the mode of a set of values is the value that occurs most often or with the greatest frequency. 
Write a function that accepts as arguments the following:

1.) An array of integers
2.) An integer that indicates the number of elements in the array.

The function should determine the mode of the array. 
That is, it should determine which value in the array occurs most often. 
The mode is the value the function should return. 
If the array has no move (none of the values occur more than once), the function should return -1. 
(Assume the array will always contain nonnegative values. 

Use pointer notation instead of array notation in this function.
